# Healthcare Charges in the US 

## Research Context
This dataset was selected amidst ongoing discussions about rising healthcare costs and insurance affordability. Recent studies indicate that many Americans face significant challenges in affording healthcare, with a substantial portion reporting difficulties even with insurance coverage. 

Common preconceptions suggest that factors like age or BMI directly correlate with increased health risks, such as obesity or cardiovascular disease. While these factors can contribute to overall health risk, it's essential to examine whether data supports these assumptions. Understanding these nuances is crucial for developing fair and accurate insurance models that avoid oversimplified risk assessments.
