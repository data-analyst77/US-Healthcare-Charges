# Healthcare Charges in the US 

## Research Context
This dataset was selected amidst ongoing discussions about rising healthcare costs and insurance affordability. Recent studies indicate that many Americans face significant challenges in affording healthcare, with a substantial portion reporting difficulties even with insurance coverage. 

Common preconceptions suggest that factors like age or BMI directly correlate with increased health risks, such as obesity or cardiovascular disease. While these factors can contribute to overall health risk, it's essential to examine whether data supports these assumptions. Understanding these nuances is crucial for developing fair and accurate insurance models that avoid oversimplified risk assessments.

## Project Objectives 
This project provides health insurance providers and policy makers with data-driven insights into healthcare costs by identifying and contextualizing key risk factors using practice-set data. It features a visual storyboard that highlights influential factors and their predictive strength, supported by analytics and scripts for further exploration. Policy makers can use these insights to monitor healthcare cost trends and implement timely interventions, while insurers can leverage the data for budgeting and risk assessment. Both groups can apply the findings to develop preventive measures and promote healthier populations. The interactive storyboard will be hosted on Tableau, with analytics and scripts available on GitHub for transparency and reproducibility.

## Guiding Questions
1.	Is there evidence to support the common assumption of a positive linear relationship between BMI, age, smoking, and healthcare costs?
2.	How do health variables (such as smoking and BMI) differ between genders? Do these differences also translate into varying healthcare charges by gender?
3.	How is obesity (BMI) related to smoking? Is there a positive linear relationship between the two?
4.	What types of regional differences can be detected in healthcare costs and health factors?

## Data 
**Kindly note the '02_Data' file was not uploaded due to storage space**.  
The dataset used in this project, insurance.csv, can be obtained from Kaggle [Insurance Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mirichoi0218/insurance/data). Kaggle is a collaborative platform for data scientists and analysts, and this particular dataset is linked to a learning dataset provided on GitHub. According to the information available on Kaggle, the dataset is synthetically generated and was last updated approximately seven years ago. Additionally, no specific timeframe is provided for the data. As a result, this dataset should not be considered reliable for real-world health policy decisions but can still serve as a useful tool for exploratory analysis and methodological demonstrations. 

**Data Description**
The dataset consists of 1,338 rows with seven variables, providing insights into how health and location factors may impact health insurance expenses:  
- age: Age of the primary beneficiary.  
- sex: Gender of the insurance contractor (female or male).  
- BMI: Body mass index, indicating whether body weight is relatively high or low compared to height.  
  - An objective index of body weight (kg/mÂ²), calculated using the height-to-weight ratio. The ideal range is 18.5 to 24.9.  
- children: Number of dependents covered by health insurance.  
- smoker: Smoking status (yes or no).  
- region: Beneficiary's residential area in the U.S. (Northeast, Southeast, Southwest, Northwest).  
- charges: Individual medical costs billed by health insurance.  

**Data Wrangling & Cleaning** 
-	Data was checked for missing values, duplicates, mixed-type data, and correct data type. No deviations were found. 
- state: To approximate **state-level data**, a new column was added by randomly assigning states within their ([CDC-defined regions](https://www2.census.gov/geo/pdfs/maps-data/maps/reference/us_regdiv.pdf)). While this preserves broad regional trends, it does not reflect **state-specific healthcare policies, costs, or demographics**, making **state-level comparisons unreliable**.

**Further Data Analysis Results** 
The script gives detailed insight into conducted analysis, a more visual presentation was compiled on Tableau, available ([here on Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/views/Dashboard_US_Healthcharges_DA77/USHealthcareCharges?:language=en-GB&:sid=&:redirect=auth&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link))

## Limitations  
This dataset is **synthetic** and lacks a defined timeframe, limiting its reliability for real-world policy decisions. Insights should be interpreted cautiously, as potential biases in data generation may lead to misleading conclusions without validation against real-world data.  

- **BMI** is an oversimplified health indicator, as it does not account for body composition or physical fitness.  
- **Smoking status** is represented as a binary variable, which does not capture smoking frequency or intensity but serves as a simplified measure for analysis.  

## Ethical Considerations 
- While the dataset does not contain personally identifiable information (PII), there remains a risk of **bias** that could contribute to **discrimination** in insurance pricing or policy decisions. Health insurers must ensure that predictive models do not disproportionately impact vulnerable populations or reinforce existing disparities. Transparency in data use and adherence to ethical AI practices are critical to maintaining fairness and public trust in insurance decision-making.  
- Considering the limitations of the **BMI** and **smoking** variables, health insurance providers should treat this information with caution, recognizing that both variables are **oversimplified** and may not fully reflect the complexity of individual health factors.
